<p>
This utility is used to open a BioWare Encapsulated Resource File (ERF) format file and display its contents.
<br><br>
It is mostly for my own benifit.
<br><br>
It is written in Visual Studio C#. It uses some custom string, byte, and char extensions.

<h4 align="left">Notes</h4>

<p>
This is still a work in progress. Initial testing has been with hak, erf, and mod files. It works well enough for my uses.
<br><br>
There are various improvements that I can think of. I will update this as time permits. But for now ...
